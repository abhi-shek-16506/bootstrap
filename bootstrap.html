                    <p class="card-text mb-auto">Bootstrap was created at Twitter in mid-2010 by @mdo and @fat. Prior to
                        being an open-sourced framework, Bootstrap was known as Twitter Blueprint. A few months into
                        development, Twitter held its first Hack Week and the project exploded as developers of all
                        skill levels jumped in without any external guidance. It served as the style guide for internal
                        tools development at the company for over a year before its public release, and continues to do
                        so today.

                        Originally released on Friday, August 19, 2011, weâ€™ve since had over twenty releases, including
                        two major rewrites with v2 and v3. With Bootstrap 2, we added responsive functionality to the
                        entire framework as an optional stylesheet. Building on that with Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the
                        library once more to make it responsive by default with a mobile first approach.</p>
